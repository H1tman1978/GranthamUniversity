This is the programming done as assignments (and for fun) while at school. Feel free to comment, browse, borrow and/steal any code in this repository.
However, if you are a fellow student, most universities would consider using any of this code on an assignment to be cheating. I'm not going to stop you though. Please leave comments if you found any of my code useful. Thanks!
